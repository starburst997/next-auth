# @FIXME The behaviour fo the MSSQL image differs slightly from the other images
#        To make it easier to setupm run tests and maintain we probably want to
#        standardize the behaviour of the Docker images, but not a priority yet.
#        There might be a third party image that does this out of the box
#          e.g. like the one from bitnami we use for mongodb
#
# * The default username is 'sa'
# * No database is created by default
version: '2'
